IMDB Movie Review Sentiment Analysis

This project applies Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to analyze movie reviews from the IMDB dataset and classify them as positive or negative.

üìä Project Overview

Movie reviews often contain valuable opinions that can be automatically analyzed using machine learning. This project demonstrates text preprocessing, feature extraction, and classification for sentiment analysis.

üîë Key Features

Data Preprocessing: Cleaning reviews, tokenization, stopword removal, and text normalization.

Feature Extraction: TF-IDF, Bag-of-Words, and word embeddings.

Machine Learning Models: Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, Random Forest.

Deep Learning Models: LSTM/GRU with word embeddings for sequence modeling.

Evaluation: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F1-score for model comparison.

üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack

Python (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, TensorFlow/Keras, NLTK, Matplotlib)

Jupyter Notebook

üìà Results & Insights

Classical ML models (Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes) achieve good baseline performance.

Deep learning models (LSTM/GRU) outperform ML models by capturing semantic context.

Word embeddings (Word2Vec / GloVe) significantly improve accuracy.
